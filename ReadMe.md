# Electricity and carbon emission prediction 
## Based on Seattle housing dataset

I realized a data exploration and cleaning work on the exploratory notebook.

In the prediction notebook, I worked on feature engineering. I tested different model for prediction (Linear Regression, regularized regression, SVR and RandomForest) and I worked on hyper-parameter tunning and interpretability using Shape library. 

Notebooks are in English. 
You can find further explanation in French in the presentation slides.
